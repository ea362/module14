## 📡 API Overview

### Calculation BREAD Operations

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| POST | `/calculations` | Create a new calculation |
| GET | `/calculations` | List all user's calculations |
| GET | `/calculations/{id}` | Get a specific calculation |
| PUT | `/calculations/{id}` | Update a calculation's inputs |
| DELETE | `/calculations/{id}` | Delete a calculation |

## 🖥️ Front-End Pages

| Page | URL | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dashboard | `/dashboard` | List, create, and delete calculations |
| View Calculation | `/dashboard/view/{id}` | View calculation details |
| Edit Calculation | `/dashboard/edit/{id}` | Edit calculation inputs |

## 🧪 Running E2E Tests

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# Run E2E tests
pytest tests/e2e/test_calculation_bread_e2e.py -v

# Run with UI (headed)
pytest tests/e2e/test_calculation_bread_e2e.py -v --headed

# Calculations App

A FastAPI web application with JWT-based authentication and full BREAD (Browse, Read, Edit, Add,
Delete) support for calculations. Users register, log in, and manage a personal history of
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calculations through both a REST API and a
server-rendered web UI.

- **API**: `POST /calculations`, `GET /calculations`, `GET /calculations/{id}`,
  `PUT /calculations/{id}`, `DELETE /calculations/{id}` — all scoped to the authenticated user.
  Interactive docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc`.
- **Web UI**: `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/dashboard` (browse + add), `/dashboard/view/{id}`
  (read), `/dashboard/edit/{id}` (edit), with delete available from both the dashboard and the
  view page.

## Running the app

### With Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This starts the FastAPI app on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), a PostgreSQL 17
database, and pgAdmin at [http://localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050)
(`admin@example.com` / `admin`). Tables are created automatically on startup.

### Without Docker

1. Have a PostgreSQL instance available and export a `DATABASE_URL` (or create a `.env` file —
   see `app/core/config.py` for all supported settings):

   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/fastapi_db
   export JWT_SECRET_KEY=change-me-to-something-random-32-chars-plus
   export JWT_REFRESH_SECRET_KEY=change-me-too-something-random-32-chars
   ```

2. Install dependencies and run the app:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Running tests locally

The test suite has three layers: unit tests (`tests/unit`), API integration tests
(`tests/integration`), and browser-driven Playwright E2E tests (`tests/e2e`). The E2E and
integration tests boot a real `uvicorn` server against your `DATABASE_URL`, so a reachable
PostgreSQL instance is required (e.g. `docker-compose up db`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run everything (unit + integration + e2e)
pytest

# Skip the slower, browser-driven E2E tests
pytest -m "not e2e"

# Only the BREAD end-to-end UI tests
pytest tests/e2e/test_calculation_bread_e2e.py -v
```

Coverage reports are generated automatically per `pytest.ini` (terminal + `htmlcov/`).

## CI/CD

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every push/PR to `main`:

1. **test** — installs dependencies, installs Playwright's Chromium browser, spins up a
   PostgreSQL service container, and runs the full `pytest` suite.
2. **docker-build-push** — on pushes to `main` only, once `test` passes, builds the image from the
   `Dockerfile` and pushes it to Docker Hub, tagged `latest` and with the commit SHA.

The push job requires `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` to be configured as repository
secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions) — it will fail until those are added.


## Project layout

- `app/main.py` — FastAPI app: web routes, auth endpoints, and the calculations BREAD endpoints.
- `app/models/calculation.py` — polymorphic SQLAlchemy models (Addition/Subtraction/
  Multiplication/Division) with a factory method and per-type `get_result()`.
- `app/schemas/calculation.py` — Pydantic request/response schemas and validation rules.
- `templates/` + `static/` — Jinja2 templates and CSS/JS for the web UI.
- `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/e2e` — the three test layers described above.
- `docs/` — module-by-module walkthroughs of how this project was built (course reference
  material).

## Further reading

See `docs/00-course-overview.md` through `docs/08-containerization.md` for a guided walkthrough of
how each part of this application (models, schemas, auth, API endpoints, frontend, testing, and
containerization) was built.
